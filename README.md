# HOTA
An HTML5 RPG.

For anyone else horrified at the disaster of commits, it's because I'm coding at school. Somehow the fucks managed to block all js on local html files, so loading up a repository became the only way to do this sort of thing. So, I have to commit, wait 10 minutes, and then finally see the change of two fucking characters.

Anyways, here's a whole fucking RPG, mostly out of spite.
